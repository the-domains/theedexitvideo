<article style=""><h1>Swallowed magnet by a child</h1><p>Kids swallow all kinds of objects most are not a big deal, but some are potentially very serious!</p></article>

My parents claim that on the day after my first birthday I pooped one of those little green army men. Yes, you heard me right. Now I am too young to remember but I believe the story, and I share this story with almost every parent that comes through the ER with a kid who swallowed something. 

I have seen patients that have swallowed coins, marbles, cement nails, screws, batteries, etc. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e0c1ee5c215e3af13476a19ffe21a520ffa7e500.jpg)

The picture above shows a KUB (Kidney Ureter Bladdes) X-Ray of a young 4 year old child who swallowed a magnet. It is the bright object in the upper part of the picture. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/25da8790892ee32c32a3a8e3b867a050b450f8e3.jpg)
