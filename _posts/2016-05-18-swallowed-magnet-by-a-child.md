<article style=""><h1>Swallowed magnet by a child</h1><p>Kids swallow all kinds of objects most are not a big deal, but some are potentially very serious!</p></article>

My parents claim that on the day after my first birthday I pooped one of those little green army men.

Yes, you heard me right. Now I am too young to remember but I believe the story, and I share this story with almost every parent that comes through the ER with a kid who swallowed something.

I have seen patients that have swallowed coins, marbles, cement nails, screws, batteries, and yes...even hidden "Mickeys".

The picture above shows a KUB (Kidney Ureter Bladdes) X-Ray of a young 4 year old child who swallowed a magnet. It is the bright object in the upper central part of the picture.

What? It doesn' look like a magnet! Well that is because it is actually a polished magnetic rock.

So...smooth object, already is in the stomach. Likely to pass on it's own. Patient is discharged home with interval 48 hour follow up in the ER for reassessment.

the follow up radiograph 2 days later reveals that the foreign body (the magnet) has not passed the pylorus (the narrow exit of the stomach into the small bowel). Not only that but also the stomach itself is distended and full of gas. The patient? He is doing just fine...no abdominal pain, no nausea or vomiting, no abdominal distention. 

But...I was concerned enough about this x-ray to call a pediatric gastroenterologist and discuss the care and treatment. He looks up his 'reference cards' and states that the object, as measured in the x-ray, is on the limits of what is considered passable at this age. So patient was referred for non urgent endoscopy 2 days from this evaluation. Hoping that in those 2 days the patient will hopefully pass the swallowed magnet, but if NOT then they will remove it through endoscopy. Of course if in those 48 hours the patient develops any abdominal symptoms, then the endoscopy will be done urgently.
